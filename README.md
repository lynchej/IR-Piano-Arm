# IR-Piano-Arm
The IR Piano Arm is based off of my original design from ECE 387 Embedded Systems Design at Miami University. 
The IR Piano Arm is similar to the Piano Arm, as it can play the piano. 
However, the biggest difference is that the IR Piano Arm is controlled by an IR signal. 
This project serves as my final project.
